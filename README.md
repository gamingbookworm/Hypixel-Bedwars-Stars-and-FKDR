# Hypixel-Bedwars-Stars-and-FKDR
Hi, I'm Alex.
Out of pure curiousity I decided to figure out if hypixel bedwars stars actually correlated to anything as I was getting annoyed at not being able to join a party in lobby one as a 81 star.
I take various stats off a player and I'm hoping that with some fancy graphs, I can see if my frustrations regarding the general consensus of stars=skill is justified or not.
My current hypothesis is that stars are simply the amount of experience a player has in bw, so I think that there will be a weak positive non-linear correlation, meaning that there are also plenty of high stars (200-500) who are pretty average, as well as lower stars (0-100) that are really good, and that average fkdr will increase significantly once I get out of stone prestige.
I will never find out if the low stars with high fkdr are alts or not, but for the purpose of research I'm going to assume that they are all seperate people.
